## MySQL IMDB PROJECT
**Project Overview:** The MYSQL-IMDB project is focused on creating a comprehensive database of movies using MySQL, designed to store and manage extensive data sourced from the IMDB database. The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient and scalable database structure that supports various queries and analyses related to movies, genres, actors, directors, and other related entities. The project involves importing, preprocessing, and normalizing a dataset of movies, and creating a series of tables, views, stored procedures, and functions to facilitate complex queries and data analysis.
